## Key Concepts Summary

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The ComfyUI Asset Manager implements **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters pattern) with these key characteristics:

- **Domain Core**: Pure business logic (Entities, Services, Value Objects)
- **Driving Ports**: Define what the application can do (use cases)
- **Driven Ports**: Define what the application needs (dependencies)
- **Adapters**: Handle infrastructure concerns and external integrations

### 📊 Current Status

- ✅ **Domain Core**: 100% complete with comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Ports**: All interfaces defined and documented
- 🚧 **Adapters**: Partially implemented, needs completion
- ❌ **Integration**: Dependency injection and wiring needed

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: 64 tests with 96-100% coverage for domain services
- **Mock-based**: All dependencies mocked for isolation
- **Contract Tests**: Planned for adapter implementations
- **Integration Tests**: Needed for complete request flows

## Development Workflow

### 🔄 Typical Development Flow

1. **Understand the Architecture** → Read hexagonal architecture docs
2. **Check Current Status** → Review implementation status
3. **Plan Your Changes** → Use developer guide patterns
4. **Implement** → Follow established patterns
5. **Test** → Use provided testing patterns
6. **Review** → Ensure architecture compliance

### 📋 Before You Start Coding

- [ ] Understand hexagonal architecture principles
- [ ] Know the difference between driving and driven ports
- [ ] Understand dependency flow (always inward to domain)
- [ ] Review existing service implementations
- [ ] Set up development environment and run tests

### ✅ Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Business logic is in domain services, not adapters
- [ ] Dependencies flow inward toward domain core
- [ ] Ports are properly classified (driving vs driven)
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with mocks
- [ ] Input validation in domain services
- [ ] Graceful error handling
- [ ] No infrastructure imports in domain layer

## Questions and Support

### 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: Should my new feature be a driving or driven port?**
A: Ask yourself: "Is this something external actors want to trigger (driving) or something the application needs from infrastructure (driven)?" See [Port Classification](./hexagonal-architecture.md#port-classification).

**Q: Where should I put business logic?**
A: Always in domain services or entities, never in adapters. See [Developer Guide](./developer-guide.md#working-with-domain-services).

**Q: How do I test my changes?**
A: Use unit tests with mocks for domain services, integration tests for adapters. See [Testing Patterns](./developer-guide.md#testing-patterns).

**Q: What's the next priority for implementation?**
A: Check [Next Implementation Steps](./current-implementation-status.md#next-implementation-steps) for prioritized tasks.
