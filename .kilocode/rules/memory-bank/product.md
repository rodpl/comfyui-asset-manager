# Product: ComfyUI Asset Manager

## Problem Solved
This project aims to solve the cumbersome process of managing assets within ComfyUI. Users often struggle with organizing, finding, and installing models, checkpoints, and other resources. This extension provides a centralized and intuitive interface for all asset-related tasks, streamlining the user's workflow.

## How it Works
The ComfyUI Asset Manager is a web-based extension integrated directly into the ComfyUI interface. It provides a tabbed interface with three main sections:
- **Local Assets:** Allows users to browse, organize, and manage their locally stored assets.
- **Model Browser:** Enables users to connect to external model-sharing platforms like CivitAI and HuggingFace to browse and download new assets directly into their ComfyUI setup.
- **Outputs:** A gallery to view, sort, and manage images and other outputs generated by ComfyUI.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for both new and experienced ComfyUI users.
- **Efficiency:** Reduce the time and effort required to manage assets.
- **Integration:** Provide a seamless experience that feels like a native part of ComfyUI.
