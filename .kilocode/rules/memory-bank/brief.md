### Project Brief: ComfyUI Asset Manager

#### Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a ComfyUI extension for asset management. This extension will simplify the process of handling models, checkpoints, and other assets within ComfyUI. It will also feature integration with popular model-sharing platforms like CivitAI and HuggingFace, enabling users to browse and download assets directly. The concept is based on the asset management capabilities of the Stability Matrix application.

#### Technology Stack
*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Frontend:** React

#### Key Features
*   **Local Asset Management:** A user-friendly interface for organizing and managing assets stored locally.
*   **External Model Browser:** Seamless browsing and downloading of models from CivitAI and HuggingFace.
*   **Output Management:** A gallery for viewing, sorting, and managing the outputs generated by ComfyUI.

#### Architecture Overview
The extension will be built with a Python backend that extends ComfyUI's native functionalities and a React-based frontend that provides the user interface. The backend will be responsible for all file system operations and communication with external APIs, while the frontend will deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience.
