# ComfyUI Asset Manager

A powerful ComfyUI extension that brings comprehensive asset management directly into your ComfyUI interface. Inspired by Stability Matrix, this extension simplifies how you organize, discover, and manage your AI models and outputs.

## What It Does

ComfyUI Asset Manager transforms the way you handle assets in ComfyUI by providing a centralized, user-friendly interface for all your asset management needs. No more switching between file explorers, web browsers, and ComfyUI - everything you need is right at your fingertips.

## Key Features

### Local Asset Management
- **Organize Your Collection**: Browse and manage all your locally stored models, checkpoints, LoRAs, and other assets in one place
- **Smart Organization**: Sort, filter, and categorize your assets for quick access
- **Asset Information**: View detailed information about each asset including file size, type, and metadata

### Model Browser & Discovery
- **Direct Platform Integration**: Browse and download models directly from popular platforms like CivitAI and HuggingFace
- **One-Click Downloads**: Install new models without leaving ComfyUI
- **Preview & Information**: See model previews, descriptions, and ratings before downloading
- **Smart Installation**: Automatically places downloaded models in the correct ComfyUI directories

### Output Gallery
- **Visual Gallery**: View all your ComfyUI-generated images and outputs in an organized gallery
- **Smart Sorting**: Sort outputs by date, workflow, or custom tags
- **Batch Operations**: Manage multiple outputs at once - delete, move, or organize with ease
- **Workflow Tracking**: See which workflow generated each output

## Why Use ComfyUI Asset Manager?

### Before
- Manually downloading models from websites
- Navigating complex folder structures

- Switching between multiple applications
- Difficulty organizing generated outputs

### After
- Everything managed from within ComfyUI
- One-click model downloads and installation
- Organized, searchable asset library
- Streamlined workflow
- Beautiful output gallery with smart organization

## Perfect For

- **AI Artists** who want to focus on creating rather than managing files
- **Workflow Enthusiasts** who use multiple models and need organization
- **Content Creators** who generate lots of outputs and need easy management
- **Teams** who share and collaborate on AI projects
- **Anyone** who wants a cleaner, more efficient ComfyUI experience

## Experience

The extension integrates seamlessly into ComfyUI's sidebar, providing a native feel that doesn't disrupt your existing workflow. The intuitive tabbed interface makes it easy to switch between managing local assets, discovering new models, and organizing your outputs.

Think of it as bringing the best parts of Stability Matrix directly into ComfyUI - but as a lightweight, integrated extension rather than a separate application.

2. Place it in your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory
